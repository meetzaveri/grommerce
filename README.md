# Grommerce ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/Grommerce/grommerce-frontend.svg?branch=development)

An ecommerce platform to as an utlity for developers. The project is focussed on e-commerce store/warehouse handling where the store owners can manage their stuff that they are going to sell along with the orders and their customers.

## Scope

Grommerce will provide a control panel where you can manage everything from stocks to customers to orders to sale for your Grocery related e-commerce.

## Why only Grocery?

Well, there is no particular answer to this because the aim of this whole project is to just concentrate on Grocery items first and who knows if this gets successful we might move to other domains as well? Therefore, we are doing it open source.

## Features

Since it is highly recommended for store owners only, therefore the following features are centered around them only.

- The store owner will be able to add, edit, retrieve and delete the product and it's information.
- The owner will also be able to generate a bill with it's original business number and can choose from the variety of templates for the bills.
- The owner will also be able to get the order request from the customers once they are done with their side of process and then the owner will be in a position of completing the order from his/her end.
- Everything whether it's order, payment or even the product is being viewed the most times, everything is aimed to be at realtime.

## Why should I use this?

If you own a Grocery Store which has online platform and you are also enabling the online transactions then you might need a control panel where you can have a idea about your stocks, your overall sale conversion, your overall profit, your overall revenue.

## Roadmap & future features

### December 2018

- Admin Dashboard Layout
- Products Page new design
- Functionality of adding, editing and deleting the product.

## Specializations

As the name suggests, this ecommerce project will only allow grocery based stocks to handle. That means we are open for grocery based ecommerce stocks. Currently we are set on this, but in future we might add another domain to support more areas.
